# Todo Application

A todo application written by Vue3 & Pinia.

## Getting start

### Frontend

Firstly, clone this repo which is frontend project of todo application:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jiesia/todo-app-ui.git
```

You need to install dependencies and then you can run it:
```bash
npm i # pnpm i
npm run dev
```

At this time, the frontend service will run at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

But now the backend service of todo application is not working. So it can't work well.

### Backend

Secondly, clone another repo which is backend project of todo application:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jiesia/todo-app.git
```

Similarly, you also need to install dependencies for the backend project so that you can run it:
```bash
npm i # pnpm i
npm run dev
```

At this time, the backend service will run at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

### MongoDB
Todo application chooses to use MongoDB as the database storage service. So you must install it on your device.

At this point, your todo project can run normally.
